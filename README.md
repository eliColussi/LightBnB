* `public` contains all of the HTML, CSS, and client side JavaScript. 
  * `index.html` is the entry point to the application. It's the only html page because this is a single page application.
  * `javascript` contains all of the client side javascript files.
    * `index.js` starts up the application by rendering the listings.
    * `network.js` manages all ajax requests to the server.
    * `views_manager.js` manages which components appear on screen.
    * `components` contains all of the individual html components. They are all created using jQuery.
* `sass` contains all of the sass files. 
* `server` contains all of the server side and database code.
  * `server.js` is the entry point to the application. This connects the routes to the database.
  * `apiRoutes.js` and `userRoutes.js` are responsible for any HTTP requests to `/users/something` or `/api/something`. 
  * `json` is a directory that contains a bunch of dummy data in `.json` files.
  * `database.js` is responsible for all queries to the database. It doesn't currently connect to any database, all it does is return data from `.json` files.
